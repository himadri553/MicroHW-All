1. What type of ADC is used?
Ans: 16-channel, 10-bit ADC

2. The datasheet mentions a noise-cancelling mode for the ADC. In one or two sentences, what does this mode do and when might you want to use it?
Ans: The ADC Noise Reduction mode stops the CPU and all I/O modules except Asynchronous Timer and ADC, to minimize switching noise during ADC conversions. This improves the noise environment for the ADC, enabling higher resolution measurements.

3. How do you find the input voltage of the signal given the ADC value?
Ans:
